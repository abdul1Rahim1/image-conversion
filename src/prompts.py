"""Prompt library for image edits and copy rewrites."""

# Prompts are ordered by safety for e-commerce use. Index 0 (front-facing,
# clean white background) is the default when only one image is generated —
# it's the shot customers expect on a product listing and the least likely
# to be misread by the model. Later prompts add angle variety when N > 1.
